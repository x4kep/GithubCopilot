JS

---

Use modern ES syntax with const, let, arrow functions, and async/await.
Prefer pure functions and avoid side effects.
Validate all inputs at function boundaries.
Keep functions small and single-purpose.
Avoid global state; encapsulate logic in modules or classes.
Use descriptive variable and function names.
Always handle async errors with try/catch.
Favor immutability and avoid mutating shared objects.
Extract duplicated logic into reusable utilities.
Write decoupled, testable code.
Modularize code into separate files based on functionality.

HTML

---

Use semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs.
Ensure exactly one h1 per page.
Always associate form inputs with labels.
Use ARIA only when native semantics are insufficient.
Avoid inline styles and inline JavaScript.
Provide meaningful alt text for images.
Maintain a correct heading hierarchy.
Avoid unnecessary wrapper elements.
Write valid, well-formed HTML.
Structure HTML based on content meaning, not styling.

CSS

---

Style primarily using class selectors.
Follow a consistent naming convention such as BEM.
Avoid deeply nested selectors.
Do not use !important unless explicitly justified.
Use Flexbox and Grid for layouts.
Keep CSS modular and component-based.
Use CSS variables for design tokens.
Design responsive styles by default.
Avoid hardcoded magic numbers.
Optimize CSS for readability and maintainability.

## GENERAL

Always create UI components but later create javascript files to handle the logic and data separately.
